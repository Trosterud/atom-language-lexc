# atom-language-lexc
 Lexc language package for Atom 

A niche but amazing language I used for work which had no syntax highlighting anywhere, so I wrote my own.


The one-liner to install in terminal (if you have the atom package manager apm installed):

´´´bash
apm install language-lexc
´´´

Or if you don't have the atom package manager or just you prefer graphically you can either do it in Atom:

- click `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Install` and search for `language-lexc`.

- Or download it from https://atom.io/packages/language-lexc


PS, now that development for Atom has stopped in favor of VS Code I won't be using Atom nor updating thi too much anymore. Though I will eventually remake this for VS Code (and/or VIM) when I have a chance to work on Finite State Transducers with LexC or TwolC again :)

In the mean time if you work with XFST's in Atom check out Janis Pagels syntax stuff here: https://github.com/pagelj/language-xfst .
